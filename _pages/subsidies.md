*SEM 2025 is happy to support travel-related expenses up to a maximum of USD 750 to a lead student author with an accepted paper at *SEM 2025. Priority will be given to applicants from developing countries who would not have adequate financial support to attend *SEM in person. The authors of all accepted papers will be contacted by the program chairs with information on how to apply.
