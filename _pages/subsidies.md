*SEM 2025 is happy to support travel-related expenses up to a maximum of USD 750 to a lead student author with an accepted paper at *SEM 2025. Priority will be given to applicants from developing countries who would not have adequate financial support to attend *SEM in person. Please contact the [program chairs via email](/cfp#questions) after the [notification deadline](/#important-dates) with a statement describing why you would require travel support and whether you will be able to cover other expenses (registration, accommodation, etc.) from other sources if you are provided partial travel expense support by *SEM.
