*SEM brings together researchers interested in the semantics of natural languages and its computational modeling. The conference embraces a wide range of approaches including data-driven, neural, probabilistic and symbolic; practical applications as well as theoretical contributions are welcome. The long-term goal of *SEM is to provide a forum for NLP researchers working on any aspect of natural language semantics.

*SEM invites submissions related to the computational modelling of natural language semantics (understood broadly) and its application. Relevant areas include (but are not limited to) theoretical aspects of computational semantics, empirical and data-driven approaches, resources, evaluation and applications/tools.

*SEM encourages authors to consider ethical aspects of their work, and to address and discuss ethical questions and implications relevant to their research. *SEM also values reproducibility and particularly welcomes submissions that adhere to the reproducibility guidelines as specified [here](https://folk.idi.ntnu.no/odderik/reproducibility_guidelines.pdf).

## Submission Instructions

Submissions must describe unpublished work and be written in English. We solicit both long and short papers. Long papers describe original research and may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references. Appendices are allowed after the references, but the paper should be self-contained and reviewers will not be required to check the appendices, if any. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. Short papers describe original focused research and may consist of up to four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages for references. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given five (5) content pages in the proceedings. Authors are encouraged to use this additional page to address reviewers comments in their final versions.

Limitations and Ethics Statement sections are allowed and encouraged, but are not mandatory. These sections should be placed after the conclusion and will not count towards the overall page limit.

Submissions should follow the [ARR formatting requirements](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).

### Submission routes and deadlines

*SEM solicits both direct submissions and  ACL Rolling Review (ARR) commitments. The deadline for direct submissions is **May 30, 2025**, and these submissions will be reviewed by the *SEM2025 program committee. ACL Rolling Review (ARR) submissions can be committed to *SEM up to **August 22, 2025** (authors of ARR-reviewed papers need to include their OpenReview link with reviews in the submission form. Both types of submissions are made through OpenReview.

**Multiple submission policy:** *SEM does not prohibit the submission of work that is under consideration for another venue at the same time as the *SEM review period. However, authors of such papers will be asked to declare this at submission time.
