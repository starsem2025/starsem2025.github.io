## Welcome!

The 14th Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM 2025) is organized and sponsored by SIGLEX, the Special Interest Group of the [ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/). *SEM brings together researchers interested in the semantics of natural languages and its computational modeling. The conference embraces data-driven, neural, and probabilistic approaches, as well as symbolic approaches and everything in between; practical applications as well as theoretical contributions are welcome. The long-term goal of *SEM is to provide a stable forum for the growing number of NLP researchers working on all aspects of semantics of (many and diverse!) natural languages.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59pm UTC-12h, AoE
