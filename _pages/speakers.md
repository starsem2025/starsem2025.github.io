**On reasoning and generalization of LLMs**

**Abstract:** LLMs and human reasoning have many differences. In this talk, I will share some insights from the perspective of causality in reasoning. I will start with some results on the linguistic reasoning of different language models, showing that the statistics across dataset differs from human. I will further show some discussion that the CoT of LLMs lack causality, which is a fundamental cause for the difference. I will then move on to show the consequence, namely lack of out-of-distribution generalization for current LMs. There will be evidences on different benchmarks for NLU, and also on the ICL and CoT for LLMs. I will share some insights how to address such issues from data curation and reinforcement learning. Then I will show how to leverage such difference for automatically detecting LLM generated text.

**Bio:** Yue Zhang is a tenured Professor at Westlake University (<https://frcchang.github.io>). His research interests include fundamental NLP and its machine learning algorithms, and his recent research focuses on LLM reasoning and AI scientist. His major contributions to the field include machine learning algorithms for structured prediction (e.g., parsing and IE), neural NLP models (i.e., lattice and graph LSTM), and generalization for NLP/LM (e.g., OOD and logical reasoning). He co-authored the Cambridge University Press book "Natural Language Processing -- a Machine Learning Perspective". Yue Zhang served as a PC co-chair for CCL 2020, EMNLP 2022, and LMG 2025. He served as tutorial co-chair for ACL 2020, and test-of-time award committee co-chairs for ACL 2024 and 2025. He currently serves as editor-in-chief for the Large Language Model journal, action editor for TACL, and associate editor for TASLP, TALLIP, TBD, and CSL.
